 * Subclasses of VSOInfoGenericController are instanciated and dealloced on the fly, at the demand of the front end user.
 * Some sublasses needs to have all the points (for instance to draw the path) while other may only need infos which are in currentRecordingInfo.
 * Points are given on the fly with setCurrentLocation:. If an instance is dealloced, it cannot get points on the fly.
 * The property below informs the controllers of the subclasses to store points which cannot be given in the currentRecordingInfo, with key VSO_REC_LIST_STORED_POINTS_FOR_CLASS_KEY(class).
 * It is up to the subclass to use and clear the stored points. */
