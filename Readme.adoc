Register your trips and export them as GPX files.

== Notes
We currently have included a `UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities` with a `location-services`
value (`gps` is too much I think, we don’t need GPS accuracy to be able to record something).
Later (when we offer trip sync w/ iCloud) we should probably get rid of this required capability!
